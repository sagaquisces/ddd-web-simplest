          <p><strong>ABOUT THE CAREGIVER</strong></p>
          <p>
            "Heaven" is a state of mind - peace of mind - and this is what I
            hope to give my furry guests by providing a safe and comfortable
            boarding experience. I adore caring for sweet doggies in my cozy
            home and have created a secure, soothing, and relaxing environment
            so my furry guests feel at home. I enjoy being at home and always
            staying very close to home. Your dog will be treated like family and
            will not be alone at night as I always sleep overnight in my home. I
            was born and raised in Pasadena, California, received my Bachelor of
            Science from Ambassador College in 1992, have been a resident of our
            beautiful desert for over 15 years, and have been caring for dogs as
            a sole-proprietor in my Palm Springs community since 2015. I enjoy
            working with kind families who trust me and are respectful of my
            policies.

            ...which is my neighborhood <strong>PUBLIC</strong> shopping plaza
            located just across the street from my home-sanctuary. I meet my
            families at this public plaza for your dog's curbside drop-off and
            pick-up out of respect for my kind neighbours within my peaceful
            residential complex and to be in compliance with my residential
            leasing and city business licensing contracts as my
            residential-based business is NOT zoned as a commercial property for
            public access. It is a wonderful privilege to operate my licensed
            and insured home-based dog boarding business where I live so I must
            be respectful of my lease agreement with property management by
            maintaining my drop-offs and pick-ups across the street from my
            home. Thank you for your kind understanding. I provide my booked
            families with my vehicle license plate number, photo/photo collage
            updates of your dog via my public INSTAGRAM, and I am happy to give
            my booked families my home address during drop-off just so you know
            where I am located across the street - just ask - but please
            remember BOTH drop-off AND pick-up are always performed at the "Palm
            Springs Market Place." Upon meeting for your dog's curbside drop-off
            your dog will be securely transported in my car for his/her short
            ride just across the street to my home-sanctuary.
          </p>
          <p>
            PLEASE NOTE: Due to my insurance and liability policy and for the
            safety of your dog there are
            <strong>NO 3rd party drop-offs or pick-ups.</strong> The dog's owner
            (the "signee") who agrees to the contract must perform, and is the
            legal responsible party for, their own dog's curbside drop-offs and
            pick-ups. If the "signee" of the contract shares ownership of the
            dog it is the "signee's" sole-responsibility to communicate the
            terms of our contract and the website policies to their spouse or
            domestic partner PRIOR to booking a reservation.
          </p>

          <p><strong>7-STEP TEXT REGISTRATION PROCESS</strong></p>
          <p>
            "Doggie Heaven's" registration/reservation process with "the signee"
            is done via TEXT as our text thread serves as our contract. Minimum
            required vaccinations: Rabies, Bordetella, and a Distemper combo
            vaccination. Some Veterinarians are also recommending a Canine
            Influenza vaccine. It is your sole-responsibility to consult with
            your dog's Veterinarian prior to boarding.
          </p>
          <p>
            1) If the date(s) you're requesting are
            <strong>CURRENTLY</strong> available at the time of your inquiry you
            will receive a series of texts to initiate a reservation request and
            begin the registration process.
          </p>
          <p>
            2) "Doggie Heaven's" 3-page "<strong
              >Guest Profile and Agreement</strong
            >" will be sent to your cell phone AFTER you confirm via TEXT that
            you (the "signee") have READ and "AGREE" to the contents of this
            website.
          </p>
          <p>
            3) Please READ the 3-page Agreement and TEXT the required
            information circled in RED, including any
            <strong
              >NON-consents or NON-agreements to paragraphs 1-15 of our
              agreement</strong
            >. Preliminary meetings, meet-n-greets, and on-site tours of my home
            are not offered as this detailed website content, my public
            INSTAGRAM video tour links, and the 3-page "Client Profile and
            Agreement" serve as our "meet n greet" so it is the
            sole-responsibility of the "signee" of the contract to provide ANY
            and ALL behavioral, pre-existing health, and/or physical challenges
            along with any medication(s), etc disclosures about their dog, that
            may affect their boarding experience, within our TEXT THREAD during
            the registration process <strong>PRIOR </strong>to submitting
            payment as our TEXT THREAD serves as our contract and supersedes any
            and all verbal or written communication by the "signee" after
            payment is submitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            4) Please TEXT the curbside drop-off AND pick-up "<strong

              to extend your dog's boarding reservation (upon availability) for
              additional hours or an additional Overnight due to
              unexpected flight, traffic, and travel delays. </strong
            >If you cannot arrive by <strong>7PM </strong>on the day of your
            dog's scheduled drop-off or pick-up you will need wait until the
            following day to re-schedule your dog's drop-off or pick-up and your
            payment is forfeited or an additional overnight boarding fee is
            automatically due, when applicable. ALL curbside drop-off and
            pick-up transitions are performed <strong>efficiently</strong> so I
            can return home to the dogs in my care so please have your dog ready
            to be transferred into my car upon meeting. Due to liability and
            insurance policy requirements, once a boarding session begins it is
            a <strong>CONTINUOUS-STAY </strong>until the mutually agreed-upon
            duration of the reservation session ends as daily and evening
            routines are established.
          </p>
          <p>
            5) To <strong>SECURE and GUARANTEE</strong> your dog's reservation
            my *Venmo, Zelle, or *PayPal ID will be texted to you to submit
            payment.
            <strong
              >POLICY: A reservation is NOT secure nor guaranteed until it is
              PAID for in FULL as I accept reservations on a "first come (PAID)
              first served" basis. </strong
            >Once you (the "signee") submit reservation payment it is
            <strong>NON-REFUNDABLE. ALL SALES ARE FINAL.</strong>

            $95 per OVERNIGHT per Puppy provides boarding for a *24-hour period.
            *Example: If drop-off is scheduled at 11am then pick-up must be by

            <strong>$50 (flat-rate)</strong> per adult dog or puppy to your
            reservation payment for the additional time of boarding.<strong>
              I close promptly at 7pm for ALL drop-offs and pick-ups.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >PLEASE NOTE: *Venmo and *PayPal now selectively charge a fee to
              the "seller" of 3% (approximately) for "goods and services" so if
              you choose to pay via Venmo or PayPal 3% must be added to your
              total. Zelle does NOT charge any fees.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>

            Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal a receipt will be texted to you to confirm
            your dog's reservation is secure.

            7) Curbside drop-off/pick-up instructions will be texted to you. I
            provide doggie guest beds, blankets, toys, and bowls. I kindly ask
            to please <strong>NOT </strong>bring your own dog's bedding, toys,
            or bowls as I provide a neutral space with freshly laundered beds,
            blankets, toys, and bowls to encourage sharing and avoid indoor
            marking and territorial issues. Dog parents provide their dog's
            secure collar/harness and leash for safety during curbside drop-off
            ALONG with their dog's meals/kibble (or core diet, if
            refrigerated/frozen dog food is your dog's core diet I have a
            refrigerator/freezer to store) for dietary consistency.
